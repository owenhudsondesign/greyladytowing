---

## APPENDIX B: NANTUCKET CONTEXT

### Why "Grey Lady"
Nantucket is nicknamed "The Grey Lady" due to the characteristic fog that often shrouds the island. When fog rolled in thick during early mornings and late evenings, sailors would say they were heading to "The Grey Lady." This name carries deep maritime heritage and local pride.

### Beach Driving on Nantucket
- Requires special permit
- Popular beaches for driving: Surfside, Madaket, Great Point, Coatue
- Sand conditions vary with tides and weather
- Rental vehicles commonly get stuck
- Local expertise is valuable (knowing tide schedules, soft spots)

### Seasonal Considerations
- **Summer:** High tourist traffic, more stuck rental vehicles, busy season
- **Off-season:** Locals, year-round residents, different challenges (weather)
- Website should serve both audiences
